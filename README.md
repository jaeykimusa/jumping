# jumping

Learning many physical interactions and dynamic motions.
Future works: to simulate dynamic jumping.

To all who have been part of my learning journey—thank you. I’m deeply grateful to NC State University, the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and the faculty, peers, and mentors who supported me through my first college experience.

I’m especially and forever grateful to my research supervisor, Dr. Jaemin Lee, for this incredible opportunity, and to my amazing team: Jakub Jon, Huan Min, Hanbin Jung, Will Joseph, Keagan Donovan, Ali Mohamed-Ali, Daniel Dong, Andrea Basuroski, and Jack Fetkovich.

To my research team—though I wish we had more time together, I understand that each of us is chasing our own path. A few of you have become my dear friends, my loved ones, and I know some are heading back to where they belong or on to even bigger dreams. I truly believe it was destiny that brought us together, and I feel so lucky to have shared this moment with you. I’ll always be rooting for your journeys—wherever they lead.

With gratitude,
